Pelotonia Mobile Donation Application
=====================================
The Mission
-----------
Pelotonia is a grassroots bike tour with one goal: **to end cancer**. Pelotonia raises money for innovative and life saving cancer research at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center - James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute. Driven by the passion of its cyclists and volunteers, and their family and friends, Pelotonia's annual cycling experience will be a place of hope, energy and determination. Pelotonia proudly directs 100% of every dollar raised to research. It is a community of people coming together to chase down cancer and defeat it.

This is an application designed to allow people involved in riding, volunteering, or fundraising for Pelotonia to solicit donations easily.  Initially we only are interested in spreading the word of Pelotonia around, but in the near future, we expect to add ride-day features as well.

The application is available in the Apple(tm) AppStore for iPhone on iOS 5.0 and above.
